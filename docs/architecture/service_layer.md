# Service Layer Architecture

## Overview
The service layer acts as an intermediary between the presentation layer (CLI/API) and the data access layer (scrapers, models). It encapsulates business logic and coordinates data flow between different components.

## Key Components

### 1. JobService
Handles all job-related operations:
- Job searching and filtering
- Job analysis and processing
- Result formatting and export

### 2. ResumeService
Manages resume-related operations:
- Resume parsing and analysis
- Skill extraction and matching
- Resume optimization suggestions

## Design Patterns

### Service Locator Pattern
- Centralized access to services
- Easy dependency injection for testing
- Simplified service lifecycle management

### Repository Pattern
- Abstracts data access
- Decouples business logic from data storage
- Simplifies testing and maintenance

## Error Handling
- Consistent error types and messages
- Automatic retries for transient failures
- Graceful degradation when possible

## Performance Considerations
- Caching strategies
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Asynchronous operations for I/O-bound tasks

## Security
- Input validation
- Rate limiting
- Sensitive data handling

## Dependencies
- Core models and types
- Scraper interfaces
- Analysis services
- Configuration management
