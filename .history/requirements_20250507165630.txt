# === Important Transitive Dependencies (Usually installed by above) ===
# Listing pandas explicitly is good practice as it's heavily used after scraping
pandas #>= 2.0.0

# Explicitly listing key sub-dependencies for clarity and consistency
httpx # Used by ollama, jobspy
requests # Used by geopy, potentially jobspy
beautifulsoup4 # Used by jobspy for parsing
lxml # Used by python-docx
python-dateutil # Used by pandas
pyarrow
# Note: playwright is installed via 'playwright install' command.
# Note: beautifulsoup4, httpx, requests etc. are pulled by jobspy/ollama/geopy
